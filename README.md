# XMLtoJSON

#### A Nodejs application to convert .XML files to .JSON  json string and XLSX files.

#### This was a previous application for a real application that I developed, to which it imports an XML file that contains various configurations of a firewall and from this XML, converted to json, a complete documentation of these configurations is generated and it is then possible to export for XLSX and PDF, as first project fullstack for y company.

#### In this application here the following solutions are used: Node.js, Express, xml2js, EJS, XLSX, HTML5 and CSS3.

#### I intend to make some improvements here, developing a more complete API, dealing with errors and non-visual improvements.
